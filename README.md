# Explainable AI-Powered Conversational Assistant for Structural Pathology Interpretation

---

**Project ID:** R&D XAI N°1

## Project Overview

This research project aims to develop an intelligent, explainable conversational assistant for interpreting automatically detected structural pathologies in accordance with Eurocode standards. Built upon the existing Aigis computer vision system, the assistant will bridge the gap between AI-based defect detection and engineering decision-making.
